                <h1>About Me.</h1>
                <h2>Hi, my name is Carolina, I am 20 years old, I am Portuguese, 
                    live in Lisbon, Portugal and I aspire to be a Graphic Designer. 
                    If you knew me you would know my passion for books, watching football games with my dad,
                    going out to dinner with my friends and if it is a Sunday you will probably find me watching a F1 Race. 
                    I am open to try new projects and learn new techniques, 
                    I would love to have the opportunity to join one of my passions with my creative side as a designer, 
                    that would be the absolute goal and dream.</h2>
