                <h2>Video Mapping Project.</h2>
                <p>For this project, my team and I created a Video Mapping with the purpose of celebrating 
                    the 50th anniversary of the 1974 Portugal Revolution. With this revolution the Salazars 
                    regime ended and if we look back in time we realize that nowadays we take things for granted,
                    such as the simple act of kissing in public or playing cards on a train. Those two themes
                    were the ones we chose to make this video mapping about. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>The animation features six characters, each carefully designed.
                    These characters form two contrasting groups: the King, Queen, and two men on the train 
                    represent the Portuguese people's yearning for freedom, while the Jack and the PIDE officer
                    represent the oppressive regime.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>The short story unfolds across three distinct settings, each carefully crafted to deepen the 
                    narrative. The first setting is a detailed recreation of Lisbon's Santa Apolónia station in the
                    1950s, emphasizing the iconic “Foguete” train that traveled between Lisbon and Porto in 1953.
                    The second environment is a lively, cartoonish bar with a vibrant, vintage aesthetic, capturing 
                    the playful spirit of the card world. Finally, a maze connects the real and card worlds, designed 
                    with specialized shaders to keep a cohesive cartoonish style. Here, the central characters—the King,
                     Queen, and Jack—come to life, adding a whimsical touch to the visual narrative.
